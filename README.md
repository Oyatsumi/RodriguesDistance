# RodriguesDistance

Distance created by me that is particularly good at iterations of discrete neighbourhoods. It is substantially faster than Euclidean and slightly faster than Chebyshev, almost reaching Manhattan-like run times.


In a 2D plane, Chebyshev and Manhattan are squares, Euclidean is a circle and the Rodrigues distance is an octagon.

This distance is also a metric if certain conditions are conserved, please refer to my publication for further details:
